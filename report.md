# Insurance Cost Prediction Project Report

## Executive Summary
Imagine you're an insurance company trying to set fair premiums for customers. This project uses machine learning to predict medical costs based on personal data, uncovering what really drives healthcare expenses. Our best models (Random Forest and XGBoost with Optuna optimization) explain **87.9% of cost variations** (R²=0.879, RMSE=$4,327-4,331), with smoking status as the dominant factor—highlighting how lifestyle choices impact health spending. We employ advanced techniques including Bayesian hyperparameter optimization (20 trials per model), SHAP interpretability, partial dependence plots, and statistical fairness testing (Welch's t-test, one-way ANOVA) to ensure both accuracy and equity.

## Dataset Overview
- **Source**: insurance.csv (1,338 anonymized records)
- **Key Insight**: Clean data with no missing values, representing diverse US demographics
- **Features**: Age, gender, BMI, children, smoking, region
- **Challenge**: Predicting charges ($1,122 to $63,771) from lifestyle factors

## Methodology

### Innovative Approach (Creativity & Novelty)
- **Optuna Optimization**: Used Bayesian hyperparameter tuning for efficient search of optimal model configurations (20 trials each for Random Forest and XGBoost)
- **XGBoost Integration**: Applied gradient boosting to iteratively correct prediction errors, achieving best performance
- **SHAP Analysis**: Used cutting-edge explainable AI to show exactly how each factor influences predictions
- **Partial Dependence Plots**: Visualized marginal effects to understand feature impacts independent of interactions
- **Feature Engineering**: Created BMI categories and age groups for better risk segmentation
- **Statistical Fairness Tests**: Conducted Welch's t-test (sex) and one-way ANOVA (region) to validate equity

### Robust Preprocessing (Methodological Soundness)
- **Encoding**: Label-encoded categorical variables (sex, smoker, region)
- **Scaling**: StandardScaler applied to features (fit on train, transform on test)
- **Feature Engineering**: Created bmi_category (underweight/normal/overweight/obese) and age_group (young/middle/senior)
- **Train-Test Split**: 80/20 split with random_state=42 for reproducibility
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold CV ensured model stability (Random Forest CV R²: 0.825 ± 0.043)
- **Validation Strategy**: Metrics computed on held-out test set to prevent overfitting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Visualizations revealed smoking's dramatic impact—smokers pay 3x more on average. Key findings:
- **Distribution**: Charges are right-skewed (mean $13,270, range $1,122-$63,771)
- **Correlations**: Smoking shows strongest correlation with charges (+0.79), followed by age (+0.30) and BMI (+0.20)
- **Boxplots**: Smokers have median charges ~$32k vs ~$8k for non-smokers
- **Regional variations**: Minimal differences suggest geographic healthcare costs are not a major factor
- **Data quality**: No missing values, clean dataset ready for modeling

## Results

### Model Performance
| Model | Test R² | RMSE ($) | MAE ($) | Key Strength |
|-------|---------|----------|---------|--------------|
| **XGBoost (Optuna)** | **0.879** | **4,331** | **2,479** | Best RMSE, gradient boosting |
| **Random Forest (Optuna)** | **0.879** | **4,327** | **2,458** | Best MAE, robust ensemble |
| Random Forest (Baseline) | 0.865 | 4,574 | 2,503 | Strong baseline, no tuning |
| Linear Regression | 0.787 | 5,747 | 4,097 | Interpretable but limited |
| Decision Tree | 0.740 | 6,354 | 2,878 | Simple but overfits |

**Key Improvements**: 
- Optuna tuning improved Random Forest R² from 0.865 to 0.879 (+1.4 percentage points)
- Both tuned models converge to R²=0.879, achieving <$4.4k RMSE
- Cross-validation confirms stability: RF achieves 0.825 ± 0.043 (5-fold CV on training data)
- Final test set metrics computed using `np.sqrt(mean_squared_error())` for sklearn compatibility

### What Drives Insurance Costs? (Interpretability)

#### Feature Importance Analysis
Both Gini-based and permutation importance methods agree:
1. **Smoker status** (dominant predictor)
2. **Age** (strong linear effect)
3. **BMI** (moderate impact)
4. **Region, Sex** (minimal influence)

#### SHAP Analysis
Quantitative insights:
1. **Smoking**: +$20,000+ impact (health risk premium) — largest SHAP values
2. **Age**: +$200/year (aging health costs) — gradual positive trend
3. **BMI**: +$500/unit above normal (obesity risks) — moderate effect with high values
4. **Region/Sex**: Minimal SHAP values → little predictive power

#### Partial Dependence Plots
Marginal effects reveal:
- **Age**: Strong linear positive relationship—charges increase ~$8-10k from age 20 to 60
- **BMI**: Gentle upward curve—accelerates above BMI 30 (obesity threshold)
- **Smoker**: Dramatic step function—being a smoker increases charges by ~$20k (largest single factor)

### Error Analysis
Residual plots show good fit with approximate homoscedasticity:
- **Mean residual**: -$222 (slight underprediction bias)
- **Std deviation**: $4,333 (consistent with RMSE)
- **Distribution**: Approximately normal, centered near zero
- **Patterns**: No major systematic errors, though slight heteroscedasticity at high charges
- **Outliers**: Few extreme residuals suggest room for improvement with edge cases
- **Overall**: Model generalizes well to held-out test data

## Fairness Assessment

### Statistical Testing
We conducted rigorous statistical tests to validate model equity:

#### Sex-Based Bias Test (Welch's t-test)
- **Mean predicted charges**: Males $13,500, Females $13,000
- **Difference**: $500 (~3.8%)
- **Test statistic**: t = -1.21
- **p-value**: 0.226 (not significant at α=0.05)
- **✅ Conclusion**: No statistically significant sex-based bias detected

#### Regional Bias Test (One-way ANOVA)
- **F-statistic**: 2.17
- **p-value**: 0.091 (marginally above α=0.05 threshold)
- **Mean charges by region**: 
  - Northeast: $13,406
  - Northwest: $12,418
  - Southeast: $14,735
  - Southwest: $12,347
- **Range**: ~$2,388 variation across 4 regions (~18% of mean)
- **✅ Conclusion**: No statistically significant regional bias—variations likely reflect genuine geographic healthcare cost differences rather than algorithmic discrimination

### Ethical Considerations & Limitations
Our model passes fairness tests for available demographic features (sex, region). However:
- **Dataset limitations**: Lacks sensitive variables (race, credit score, ZIP code) that recent NAIC studies identify as potential proxy discriminators
- **Recommendation**: Production models should undergo disparate impact analysis using frameworks like AI Fairness 360 or Fairlearn
- **Context**: Recent research reveals insurance inequities from credit scoring and adverse selection—our model avoids these controversial factors

Models are fair when based on verifiable risk factors. We recommend quarterly fairness audits and transparency in model documentation.

## Real-World Applications (Feasibility & Relevance)

### Practical Solutions
- **Personalized Pricing**: Help insurers set accurate premiums
- **Customer Insights**: Guide wellness programs targeting high-risk groups
- **Policy Design**: Inform regulations on fair pricing

### Limitations & Future Work
- **Dataset Size**: 1,338 records limit generalizability
- **Features Missing**: No medical history, genetics, or lifestyle details
- **Temporal Aspect**: Static data doesn't capture changing health
- **Recommendations**: Collect longitudinal data, add advanced models like neural networks

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data science can make healthcare pricing more transparent and fair. Our optimized ensemble models (Random Forest and XGBoost with Optuna tuning) provide highly accurate predictions (**R²=0.879, RMSE=$4,327-4,331**), while SHAP analysis and partial dependence plots ensure we understand the "why" behind each decision. Statistical fairness tests validate equitable treatment across sex (p=0.226) and region (p=0.091). For insurers, this means better risk assessment; for customers, fairer premiums based on actual health factors.
